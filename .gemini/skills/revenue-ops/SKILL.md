# Revenue Operations — Optimize the revenue engine

Analyze and optimize revenue operations for "$ARGUMENTS":

## 1. Revenue Architecture
```
Marketing → MQL → SQL → SAL → Opportunity → Design Win → Revenue
         (Lead Gen) (Qualify) (Accept) (Pipeline) (Commit) (Ship)
```

### Funnel Metrics
| Stage | Volume | Conversion % | Velocity (days) | Value ($) |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Leads / MQLs | | | | |
| SQLs (qualified) | | | | |
| SALs (accepted by sales) | | | | |
| Opportunities created | | | | |
| Design wins / commits | | | | |
| Revenue (shipped) | | | | |

## 2. Pipeline Analytics
| Metric | Current | Target | Gap | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|--------|
| Pipeline coverage (x quota) | | 3-4x | | |
| Weighted pipeline | | | | |
| Pipeline created / month | | | | |
| Pipeline velocity ($M/day) | | | | |
| Win rate (overall) | | | | |
| Win rate (by segment) | | | | |
| Average deal size | | | | |
| Sales cycle (days) | | | | |

## 3. Forecasting Model
| Category | Definition | Revenue ($M) | Confidence |
|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Closed** | Booked, shipping | | 100% |
| **Commit** | Verbal PO, high certainty | | 90%+ |
| **Best case** | Strong pipeline, likely this Q | | 60-80% |
| **Upside** | Possible, needs acceleration | | 30-50% |
| **Pipeline** | Early stage, future quarters | | 10-25% |

Forecast = Closed + (Commit x 0.9) + (Best case x 0.7) + (Upside x 0.4)

## 4. Territory & Quota Design
| Territory | Rep | Quota ($M) | Pipeline ($M) | Coverage | Attainment YTD |
|-----------|-----|-----------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| | | | | | |

**Quota-setting methodology**: Top-down (from plan) + bottoms-up (from accounts) = balanced quota
**Capacity model**: # reps x avg quota = achievable revenue. Current capacity vs plan gap.

## 5. Lead Scoring Model
| Signal | Weight | Source | Decay |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Datasheet download | +10 | Website | 30 days |
| Sample request | +25 | Website/Disti | 60 days |
