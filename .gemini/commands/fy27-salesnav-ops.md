#   Subject: "Formal verification at <company> — quick question"
#   Body: 150-200 words, personalized to their role/company news

# InMail best practices:
# - Subject: <10 words, specific to their context
# - Body: <200 words, mobile-readable
# - Include: specific observation about their work/company
# - CTA: specific time slot or low-friction next step
# - Send: Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am their timezone

### 10. buyer-intent

# Account row: .buyer-intent-account-row
# Intent score: .buyer-intent-score
# Trend indicator: .buyer-intent-trend

# High intent (score 80-100): Immediate outreach priority
# Medium intent (50-79): Schedule for next week
# Low intent (0-49): Monitor, no immediate action
# Rising (trending up): Accelerate timing

# Data to log:
# - Account name + intent score
# - Intent trend (up/stable/down)
# - Topic clusters (what are they researching?)
# - Key decision makers showing intent
# - Recommended actions from Sales Navigator
```

**Intent digest → ZK:**
```bash

## Data Enrichment Flow

```
Sales Navigator Lead → view-lead → extract profile data
  ↓
ZK ingest (lead holon)
  ↓
Cross-reference with existing ZK holons:
  - Prior conversations (check by name/company)
  - Account intelligence (check by company)
  - Pipeline data (check for existing opportunity)
  ↓
Enriched lead record = ZK holon + pipeline stage + next action
  ↓
Export to CSV for CRM import (see fy27-csv-export.md)
```
