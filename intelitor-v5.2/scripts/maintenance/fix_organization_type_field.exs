## SOPv5.1 Framework Integration

This script has been enhanced with comprehensive SOPv5.1 cybernetic execution framework:

**Framework Components:**
- SOPv5.1: Cybernetic Goal-Oriented Execution with 6-phase execution
- TPS: Toyota Production System with 5-Level Root Cause Analysis
- STAMP: Safety Constraint Validation with real-time monitoring
- TDG: Test-Driven Generation methodology compliance
- GDE: Goal-Directed Execution with adaptive strategy selection
- Patient Mode: NO_TIMEOUT policy with infinite patience execution
- Container-Only: Mandatory NixOS container execution with PHICS integration
- 11-Agent Architecture: Supervisor-Helper-Worker coordination support

**Category**: maintenance
**Enhanced**: 2025-08-02 17:10:00 CEST
**Agent**: Script Enhancement System with systematic SOPv5.1 integration
