# TAM/SAM/SOM Sizing — Market sizing with bottoms-up and top-down approaches

Size the market for "$ARGUMENTS":

## 1. Market Definition
- **Product/service scope**: What exactly are we sizing?
- **Geographic scope**: Global, regional, country-specific?
- **Customer scope**: All buyers or specific segments?
- **Time horizon**: Current year, 3-year, 5-year?
- **Currency and units**: USD, EUR? Units shipped, revenue, ASP?

## 2. Top-Down Approach (TAM)
Start from total market, narrow down:
```
Total semiconductor market ($___B, source: WSTS/SIA/Gartner)
  x Relevant segment share (___%)
  = Segment TAM: $___B

Segment TAM: $___B
  x Our addressable geography (___%)
  x Our addressable end-markets (___%)
  = SAM: $___B

SAM: $___B
  x Realistic market share (___%)
  = SOM: $___M
```

| Level | Value | Method | Source | Confidence |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| TAM | $___B | Industry reports | WSTS, Gartner, IDC | High |
| SAM | $___B | Segment + geo filter | Analyst + internal | Medium |
| SOM | $___M | Win rate x pipeline | Internal data | Medium-Low |

## 3. Bottoms-Up Approach (Validation)
Build from individual opportunities:
```
# of target accounts: ___
x Average annual spend per account: $___
x Our addressable share of spend: ___%
= Bottoms-up SOM: $___M

Cross-check:
# of design wins in pipeline: ___
x Average lifetime revenue per win: $___
x Win probability: ___%
= Pipeline-based SOM: $___M
```
